This file should be used to document changes made by developers (that means 
you. or not.), and does not go to the release packages, only to the CVS. It's
easier to read this file than to read CVS status, which are not always
meaningful... Please add an entry to the top of the file for each 
significative change you make. Follow this guideline:

() done
[] done, but should be reviewed
|| to be done, do if you can
<> Mark started or finished. Meanwhile something may be broken.
?? question: if you know, solve it
Writer: put your initials inside.
