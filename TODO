TODO LIST

Please send any ideas.

Next release (0.4x)
- improve get_line2(), implement distance_to_point and distance_to_line
- dot-matrix printouts (examples/matrix.jpg) (german: Nadeldrucker)
- examples/inverse.pcx + examples/rotate45.pcx by nearest-box-to-line alg.
  or mean nearest box (or its 4 edges) directions,
  rotate only boxes (by creating new greater boxes and tread as new image)
- proof replacement of getTextLine by getXMLline via pipe(?) or stdout
  is pipe available on all platforms?
- list of 'holes' (size,position,dimension,probability)
   per char instead of repeating slow num_hole-function in ocr0()
- improve ocr0 base-engine for screenshots (js)
- docu about ispell using via XML (what needed, test in gocr.tcl)
- replace rest of UNDEFINED in unicode.c by its correct strings
- make spacing between words line-dependend if not mono
- add probability for box->m1..m4 (to reduce errors caused by bad line-scan)
  call line detection function second time to improve unsure line data

Next release (0.5x)
- reduce pixel data by vectorization (big change, faster)
- writing images through pipes (like reading)
- using dictionary (optional) for replacing not recognized chars
- Karsten.Hilbert@gmx.net: use ORChie WordBox-format
  see http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/kathey/ocrchie.html
  aspell instead of ispell

Near future: (planned version)
- rewrite install-routine
- perspective distortion (for cameras)
- genetic algorithms engine (already in development, 0.8?). It includes
  feature extraction and classification
- support for other languages (may affect context_correction(), etc) (0.6?)
- support for diagramation. Can be done using the Unicode+new stuff. I (bbg)
  have some ideas.

Far future:
- gimp plugin
- color support
- Braille detection (usefull for blinds?)
  see: American Journal of Physics Vol. 70, No. 7, p 684-688 (2002)
  or use special foils
- read image in smaller parts, to reduce memory usage.
- frames should be recognized
- better distance function (comparision of characters)
- detection of orientation (i.a. 90,180,270deg rotation)
- picture extraction
- math formula detection, font type detection
- improve performance 
- support for parallel processing
- handwritten texts (blockletters)
   --- uff, really a lot of work ---
- Feel free and add your suggestions and wishes,
  or tell me, what is the most important point for you.
